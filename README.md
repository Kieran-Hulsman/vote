## Two Minutes
Making a voting plan is a great way to be a proactive voter and ensure that you have all the information necessary to cast your ballot in the democratic process and fulfill your civic duty as an American citizen. By saying out loud how and when you will vote proves to be almost 100% successful in voting turnout. Plan Two Vote allows users to interactively build their voting plan in just two minutes, producing a "voting statement" at the end that can be printed or added to their calendar.

## Two Methods
Amid the risk that the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States has introduced to those who vote in-person, voting by mail has become a popular talking point when discussing the November election. Chatter about operational changes of the USPS and the security of absentee ballots has produced many misunderstandings and falsehoods about voting by mail that are being spread around the internet and social media. Plan Two Vote aims to provide factual and straightforward information to ensure voters correctly understand the voting process this year. Whether a user is voting by mail or in-person, they can easily gain the information they need and formulate their voting plan in just two minutes.

## Two Months
At the initial public release of Plan Two Vote, there were only two months until the November 2020 election. Time is ticking to register to vote and request absentee ballots. Plan Two Vote can be used to expedite this process by providing the information and links necessary to accomplishing these tasks.

## Two Cents
As a high school student who is not eligible to vote, I wanted to make sure people who are eligible turn out to the polls this election. Our country had only 55% of the voting-age population vote in 2016, and the 2018 midterm election was the first time since 1982 that a midterm election had more than 50% of the voting-age population turn out to vote (source: US Census Bureau). It is unfathomable to me that the leaders in our government are elected by a minority of the population, and that is not even considering the ineligible young people in our country. I created Plan Two Vote for the 2020 [Congressional App Challenge](https://congressionalappchallenge.us) to raise awareness about our country's low voter turnout and in hopes to increase it this election.
